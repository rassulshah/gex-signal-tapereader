# RESUME NOTE — read this before anything else
_written 2026-08-31 · panel v15.09 · companion v1.16 · supersedes every earlier resume note_

---

## ⚠ 0 · THE CARRY-FORWARD CONTRACT

**This note is rewritten IN FULL every build. Anything not re-typed is GONE, silently.**

⚠⚠ **AND IT FAILED EXACTLY THAT WAY AGAIN.** The previous note carried `v15.09` in its header —
which is all `test_savedone` checks — while its body still described **v14.80**. Nine versions never
reached it and every guard stayed green. Snapshot kept as `session-state/2026-08-31_resume-v14.80.md`
so the failure is legible. **A version-keyed guard is satisfied by a stamp, not by content: when you
bump the header, rewrite the body in the same edit.**

Read in this order, in full, before anything else:

0. ⚠⚠ **`session-state/LESSONS.md`** — the failure-pattern register, then the per-build log newest
   first. It names results that have been **WITHDRAWN**; quoting one is the most expensive thing a
   fresh context can do, because it looks like knowledge.
1. **`session-state/CHAT-HISTORY.md`**, the CURRENT-CONTEXT entry — what was *said*.
2. **`session-state/LOCKED-ITEMS.md`** — agreed-but-unbuilt work. Check every build.
3. **`session-state/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md`** — so you do not re-ask what he already answered.
4. **`design/DATA-ARCHITECTURE.md`** — who can reach what.
5. **`skylit-docs/FINDINGS.md`** — F-1…F-16.

**THE LOAD CLONES FULL** (never `--depth 1`).
⚠⚠ **A COMMIT IS NOT A PUSH.** The cloud gets a 403 from the git proxy. `installvNNNN.bat`, run on
his machine, is the only route to GitHub — and the git record confirms every release on origin was
committed and pushed by **him**, never by a session.

He works **one item at a time** and expects you to **discuss before building**. He has caught more
real defects than the test suite has. **When he pushes back, he is usually right.**

## 1 · THE STANDING BUSINESS REQUIREMENT (his words)

> "I am a trader and need to know where to take trades from and where price is going, so basically I
> need to know potential support and resistance especially if it is weakening and new support and
> resistance is forming as well as where price is going."

And the frame for ⓪a, which he had to tell me and which reorganised the whole section (2026-08-30):

> "do you realize that i am taking the model of the daily bar and trying to measure the movements in
> it from open to close"

> "so the daily candle and its contstruction will be my mental model for daytrading using all of
> these measurements … its very important that this feature be a world class feature but it will
> require your help in constant refinement via the use of llm to identify additional datapoints and
> measurements to better prediction"

**What he trades, stated 2026-08-30 and now wired that way:**

    STRUCTURE    nodes · kings · walls · flip      SPXW / SPY / QQQ.  ES has no book of its own.
    MEASUREMENT  HOD · LOD · candle · EFF · GD/RD  ES's own 1-minute bars.  (`measureBars`)

> "its the es that i am trading but using spxw nodes" · "we are using other markets to get things
> like their kings because ES doesn't have its own book, so we use other tapes"

## 2 · WHERE WE ARE — v15.09, and what the face carries

**Shipped and on GitHub in one commit (`a1c6a88`), pushed by him.** Suite **129 green / 6 baseline
red** (`expiry_profile`, `node_map`, `sma_cont`, `tapeking` (needs jsdom), `trendbadge`,
`v1126_process`).

**⓪a DAY is three columns beside the candle** — 1ST · 2ND · DAY, each `label / actual / expected`,
1px rules between. The candle is on the LEFT and its height is **DERIVED**, not chosen:
`DAYCOL_HD(16) + DAYCOL_N(9) × DAYCOL_ROW(13)` — add a field and both move together.

    1ST   SLvl · HodN|LodN · TIME · TOOK · BOP · WICK · W.END · OF BAR · MUD
    2ND   TLvl · HodN|LodN · TIME · PT TOOK · PT · PTWICK · (blank) · OF BAR · PTMUD
    DAY   GD/RD · PTN · HL GAP · HL RNG · HL $ · LC GAP · LC RNG · EFF · BODY

⚠ **The blank at index 6 of the 2ND column is HIS deliberate gap** — there is no PT analogue of a
wick-end clock. It was in his very first sketch. Do not fill it.

**The read line, one line, two facts, both with their number:**

    HOD IN 100% · LOD after 1:30pm — 80%

**The rest of the face:** ② LOCATION with `secFrame` rendering inside it, and the vertical ladder.
**TREND is OFF the face since v14.90** (its DRIFT chip is a measured coin flip, 50.0%, n=68) —
`secBias()` is KEPT and still records, because `bias.confirm` is an enrolled feature.
**The GAMMA PROFILE was removed at his request (v14.81) — do not propose rebuilding it.**

**The panel is PINNED to the SPX book** (`CFG.mkt`, Settings → Market: SPX/SPY · QQQ · Auto). This
was the root of five builds of symptoms on 2026-08-30: `activeSym()` followed whatever chart was
open, so one click onto QQQ swapped the panel onto a book with none of the evidence behind it.
⚠ **A silent pin would be worse than no pin** — the face says `◉ SPY book (chart: QQQ)`.

---

## 3 · THE NUMBERS ON THE FACE — every one with its n and its date

⚠ **Never quote a rate from this project without its n and its date.** Several are one-day samples
and at least one was contradicted by a later day.

| what | value | n · window | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| ⓪a **cell** rates (`HLTAB`) | AUC 0.879, calibrated at every decile | 44,302 obs · 284 sessions · 2025-06-02→2026-08-21 | PROVISIONAL, F-4/F-11 |
| ⓪a **IN** decision (`inHit`) | **63%**, median 9:20 | n=284 | CONFIRMED, F-12 |
| ⓪a **NOT-IN** decision | **85%**, median 8:40 | n=230 | **the STRONGER of the two**, F-11/F-12 |
| far side · touch | AUC 0.826, Brier 0.147 | 388,494 obs · 197 sessions | PROVISIONAL, F-14 |
| far side · timing | first passage, AUC 0.692; `T ~ (d/σ)²` does 95% of it | 7,168 arrivals | PROVISIONAL, F-15 |
| **GREEN/RED** (`GD_META`) | **76%** on the **80%** of days it speaks, base 51%, z=8.8, CI 71–82 | n=282 · 2025-06-02→2026-08-21 | PROVISIONAL, no forward test |
| EFF expected (`EFF_META`) | **68%**, a **MEDIAN** | 284 sessions | a ratio takes a median |
| PT / LC (`PT_META`) | PT ~49m / 19.8pts · LC ~103m / 12.5pts | n=283 | **side-specific**: PT after a LOD 24.0pts, after a HOD 17.0 |
| deflections (`DEFL_META`) | 79 deflect / 25 breaks, **56% break** | 8 sessions · calibrated 2026-08-29 | detection only — see §5 |

⚠⚠ **THREE WITHDRAWN NUMBERS. NEVER QUOTE THEM:** the ⓪a IN call at **92%** (hindsight side
selection — `inHindsight:92` is kept only as a label); SUCCESSION **76% crowned within 20 bars** (does
not reproduce at any horizon; 23% at 30m against the DRAWN crown); "crowns beat chance by **17pp**"
(`study-kingdeflect.py` measured crowns where it should have measured nodes).

⚠ **DO NOT RE-PROPOSE**, all measured and recorded: sweeps (48%, below their own base), momentum
divergence (−0.0004), NQ divergence (−0.0014), IB30/IB60, the 50-SMA, open-reclaimed, the 60-minute
breakout, the daily ATR, the overnight range, volume, day-of-week, gap, prior-day and overnight level
identity, prior-day POC/VAH/VAL (gx-009, CLOSED NEGATIVE — the **sham beat the real level** twice),
the prior day's colour (AUC **0.500**), red/green from the open, a 5-feature logistic, or a narrow
high-probability timing box.

---

## 4 · WHAT IS SETTLED — do not re-litigate any of this

- **⓪a is one daily candle.** Rows are legs of it; `OF BAR` sums to 100% and that total is the check
  the decomposition is honest. **WICK% is not a ratio — it is where the OPEN sits in the bar.**
- **PTWICK = PT TOOK + PT BOP** (Q1, answered 2026-08-30): the first-extreme shape anchored on the
  SECOND extreme, as WICK is anchored on the open. **PT BOP and PT W.END were dropped** — em-dash
  most days.
- **ENHANCE HIS LAYOUT, DO NOT REDESIGN IT.** *"i dont want to deviate too much from what i have."*
  A HIGH/LOW rewrite and a per-leg rewrite were both offered and both rejected.
- ⚠⚠ **HE HAS ASKED THREE TIMES FOR A TWO-SIDED TIME WINDOW AT A HIGH NUMBER** and it cannot be built
  honestly: ±15 min lands **15%**, ±30 lands **24%**, and a two-sided window must be **3.6 HOURS**
  wide to reach 80% (197 sessions, F-13/F-15). "after X — 80%" is a **one-sided floor**; the MIDDLE
  HALF is the honest two-sided answer and it is **50%**. Show him those three numbers rather than
  re-deriving the refusal.
- **Deflection geometry is FINAL:** approach **1.0 ATR**, penetration **1.5 ATR**, triggered on the
  **WICK**; the **CLOSE** classifies deflect vs break. **One price event is ONE deflection**, never
  one per node. A **pullback is the extreme of its own 30-minute neighbourhood** — median 3/session.
- **The node universe is a RANK (top few by dollars), not a %King threshold.**
- ⚠⚠ **The node selects WHERE; the price action decides WHAT.** Node 764 on 2026-08-24: one
  deflection, two breakdowns. **Never score nodes as reliable-or-not** — it would look like a finding.
- **Levels are excluded by being mid-range, and IB is excluded BY NAME.** A level price traded through
  is near neither extreme, so one rule does both jobs; a distance test would readmit IB on any day it
  sat on a wick.
- **Ladder:** `LAD_W=640` — raised once from 618 for the roll lane, argued in the open, and the
  assertion now says *"640 IS NOW THE CAP. The next column that wants width argues for it here."*
  The chute is **price's alone** (v14.82 put names in it and he rejected it). Name→price gap is 2px,
  deliberate. `ladderRolls` is retired; its lane is the King columns.
- **Two books, never averaged.** Skylit = FLOW; InsiderFinance = OI×gamma. **Name both units out loud
  before comparing two numbers.**
- **Scale:** SPX and ES are **ten points apart** — a basis, not a conversion. **SPY is 10.04× away and
  every scale failure of 2026-08-30 had SPY in the display path.** `displayScale()` is the single
  source; `hodLod` takes its scale FROM `measureBars`, never from the ratio.

---

## 5 · HOW IT IMPROVES — the part he cares most about

1. **DATA.** Every feature self-declares once in the FEATURES registry and is recorded per bar; the
   `farside` record carries each level's **node identity** (`kind`, %King, polarity, role) — the
   gamma dataset nobody has collected.
2. **ANALYSIS.** `docs/LLM-NIGHTLY-BRIEF.md` carries the ⭐ section: score the touch call by decile,
   score the ≤20% NO call separately, run the gamma test **with a DENSE distance control** (F-16 —
   a sparse control invented a +12-point effect that vanished), and **propose** a new `FARSIDE.json`,
   never apply one.
3. **ADOPTION WITHOUT A BUILD.** Companion v1.16 couriers `BASERATES.json` and `FARSIDE.json` from
   raw GitHub; the panel **validates** them (≥120 sessions, every rated cell n≥60, monotone) and keeps
   the baked-in copy if the payload fails. ⚠ **Monotonicity is not evidence** — two synthetic sessions
   once produced `57/80/100/100/100`.
4. **THE NIGHTLY LOOP** (`tools/nightly/`): **the LLM proposes, the harness disposes.** 8 hypotheses
   are **pre-registered** — locked before the data to test them exists, which is stronger
   pre-registration than anything obtainable later. `subset_null()` is the control that matters: it
   killed four false PROVISIONALs at 82–84% that were mutually contradictory, and it exists because a
   FILTER inherits the edge it filters.
5. **THE UNTESTED INPUT.** `gpts_vix_daily_v1` holds 503 daily ^VIX closes, wired into nothing.
   Implied vol is the one volatility measure that is not a slower copy of what the panel computes.

⚠⚠ **AND THE CONSTRAINT THAT GOVERNS ALL OF IT:** the ES corpus is **284 sessions of PRICE ONLY**.
The gamma book has **~10 recorded sessions**, several of them collapsed. **Every shipped model is
price-only. Nothing using the gamma book can be tested for months.** That is not a reason to wait —
it is why the loop starts by accumulating and pre-registering.

---

## 6 · WHAT TO DO NEXT, IN ORDER

1. ⚠⚠ **THE RECORDER SHEDS THE MORNING. This is the blocker on every gamma question in §5.**
   ⚠ **The F-10 storage fix is BUILT** (v14.68/v14.76 — `lsPut`, `LS_BUDGET_KB`, `LS_HEALTH`,
   `__gptsDebug.storage`, `test_storage.js` green). `LOCKED-ITEMS.md` said "FIX NOT BUILT" until
   2026-08-31 and that was false; a parked patch in `session-state/pending/` against a **v14.67**
   base is what made it look open. **Check the code, not the ledger.**

   **What is actually wrong, measured on `data/2026-08-31.json`:**

       snapshots       131     08:30 -> 15:00 CT    the whole session
       feature records 1370    13:36 -> 15:00 CT    the NEWEST 29 bars only

   The budget is **3600 KB**; a session measures **~6 MB**. So `recorderSave()`'s shedder trims today
   oldest-first exactly as designed, the export runs at the close *after* the shedding, and every day
   file keeps only the last ~90 minutes. **The ⓪a NOT-IN call fires at a median of 08:40 and
   GREEN/RED at 09:03 — neither is ever in the record that is supposed to score them.**

   ⚠ **Nothing in the day file says this happened** — `LS_HEALTH` counts `shed`/`quotaHits` and
   `buildDayExport` carries none of it. **Exporting `LS_HEALTH` is the cheapest next step**, and it is
   what turns "the shedder did it" from a strong inference off the timestamps into a measurement.
   ⚠ Do NOT just raise the budget — that walks back toward the 10 MB cap. Weigh shedding to IndexedDB,
   exporting intraday, or recording features more cheaply.
   ⚠ **Do NOT build this during a live session** — it touches the recorder's write path.
2. **Q11 — the ex-ante deflect/break discriminator.** The only open question that matters. Detection
   is finished; the touch itself has no edge (mirror legs, 56% break, t≈0). Candidates: which book's
   king, gaining vs shedding mass into the touch, approach velocity, time of day, whether an earlier
   test held. Needs the day files that item 1 unblocks.
3. **`DEFLECT_ZONE` is still 0.50, fixed and symmetric, in 22 places.** The finalised ATR geometry
   governs only `hlNodeAt` and its hover; the live `deflectionAt`, the in-play band, the ledger touch
   zone, king taps and the invalidation levels all still use the old band. A deliberate,
   separately-tested change — not a one-line swap.
4. **Ask him Q3** (sweep levels: furthest, or all?) and **Q4** (what is the "nd" contract?).
5. **The implied-vs-realized σ study** — does VIX beat the panel's realized σ in the first-passage
   law, and at what hour does it stop helping?
6. **ITEM 18 Tier 1/2**, and the **2026-09-16 backfill deadline** for the 2026-07-18→08-14 corpus
   hole — recoverable at 2-minute resolution only until then. Untouched.

⚠ **`.gex-config.json`'s `farside` block still says "HLTAB_META.inHit still advertises 92% — fix in
the next build". IT IS ALREADY FIXED** (`inHit:63` since v14.84). That config note is stale.

⚠⚠ **THE IRT PIPE IS SOLVED — DO NOT RE-LITIGATE IT.** IRT's Remote File field reads a `file://` URL
**once, on Apply — it does NOT poll.** Standing config, verified live: `irtserve.bat` running with
autostart installed, BOTH charts on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/FlexLevelsExport.csv`, Check Every 1
Minute, feed on `gex`. ⚠ Never run that server against a panel older than v14.74.

## 7 · HOW TO WORK WITH HIM

1. **ONE AT A TIME.** State one item, its fix, ask, **STOP.** This is the most-violated rule in the
   project and breaking it has cost more rework than any bug. If a reply is taking shape with three
   headings and a "which do you prefer" — delete it.
2. **Do not build until he says build.** He says it plainly.
3. **SHOW MOCKUPS FIRST**, rendered headless at his panel width with the pairwise overlap audit.
   ⚠ **Publish design mockups as ARTIFACTS** — he comments on delivered file cards and those comments
   do not reach us; the only reason one set was ever read is that he screenshotted them.
4. **TEST BEFORE YOU BUILD.** A measurement has changed the build after it was already described.
5. ⚠⚠ **DELIVER EXACTLY ONE FILE.** His words, 2026-08-15 and restated 2026-08-27: *"you are
   supposed to just give me an install file."* One `installvNNNN.bat`, dash-free and dot-free, **plus the
   Tampermonkey links as text**, plus **tell him to click them**: run the .bat → wait ~5 min for the
   CDN → **CLICK THE LINK** → **reload the Atlas tab**. Tampermonkey's default update check is once a
   day, so the click is the reliable step. "Reinstall" means he already has it — that is correct.
6. **VERIFY THE INSTALLER BY DECODING IT** before sending. It has silently dropped whole directories
   three times, including `tools/nightly/` with the pre-registered hypothesis bank.
7. **Bump BOTH version strings** (`@version` and `GPTS_VERSION`) and the four test pins.
8. **One edit, one write, verify.** A multi-edit script that aborts writes nothing.
9. **MUTATE EVERY NEW ASSERTION INDIVIDUALLY.** "The suite is green" has never once caught a fake
   assertion; mutation has caught every one. Delete the whole construct — a condition mutation does
   not test a presence assertion, and a mutation narrower than the assertion tests nothing.
10. **End every build message with `✅ SAVE DONE`** naming what was updated.

---

## 8 · DOCTRINE THAT MUST NOT BE LOST

- **Absence of data is not a reading.** Thin cells refuse; they do not guess. And **degrade toward
  silence, not toward noise** — but **never hide real data to avoid drawing it badly** (v15.04/05).
- **A well-formed number is not a supported one.** Monotone ≠ evidence.
- **Measure the question the FACE actually puts**, and state WHEN each variable was read.
- **A matched control must SPAN its range densely**, or it invents an effect.
- **%King ranks at one instant; DOLLARS compare two moments.** A moving denominator cannot measure
  change.
- **Does it POINT or does it CONDITION?** Gamma, vanna, VIX term structure and DEX all condition.
- **Gamma tells you HOW price moves, never WHICH WAY.**
- **Before concluding data is absent, enumerate the keys of what you already hold.**
- **A count that disagrees with how the thing behaves in life is a defect in the counter.**
- **Anything unproven ships labelled unproven and scored nightly.**
